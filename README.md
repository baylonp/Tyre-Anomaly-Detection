# Tyre-Anomaly-Detection
Little summer project to study deep learning using Tensorflow and Keras. The aim is to recognise when a tyre ha problems or defects by its picture(s)


## What is it?

After a little bit of vacation I could't just wait for classes to start again and so I decided to begin studying deep learning and approaching myself to this field. 
As everything tho, without a project to actually test the theory it would have all resulted to nothing, so I imagined having a device for detecting worn tyres and in general big defects on the surface.

The idea is to build a simple binary classificator that tells me if a tyre is GOOD or DEFECTIVE: let's start simple.

## BOM: Bill Of material

What I used is:

- Jupyter Notebook is Anaconda environment
- NVIDIA RTX 2070Super
- Among all the libraries, I worked alot with Keras and Tensorflow
